# Oversalted

## Project insight

> Oversalted is a website troubleshoot forum focused on creating a a world-based community enviroment to cater towards recipe developement, muilti-ended corrections, and experimentation in hypothetical food-cooking.

## GOALS

- User to make an account
- Admin acct? Maybe. Note sure yet with this one as the only reasoning right now is to add new tags but there are other methods of doing so.
- User submit Question
- Review/edit question
- Generalized tag list

## CURRENT Stretch Goals

- Voting system that lets each user vote 1-3 times per forum on valid answers. This does not stack.
- Feed that sorts by top three best answer, then sorts the rest by timeline of posted

=======


## Notes

> The tag system: keywords are based on the search system.
1)The goal is to have forums that have tags and are sorted by such. Users cannot add new tags however they can request one to be added.

Pageview concept setups
> Public

- [personalized]feed
- questions
- catagories[tags]
- users [to be friends with each other]

> Incubators (open groups focused on their own topics) Thinking something like a makers guild or potentially used for buisnesses to help staff
