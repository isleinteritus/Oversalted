# Oversalted

## Project insight

> Oversalted is a website troubleshooting forum focused on creating a all-world-based community enviroment to cater towards food-troubleshooting, recipe developement, muilti-ended corrections to such recipes, and experimentation in hypothetical food-cooking.


## Future programatic Goals

- Voting system that lets each user vote up to three times per forum on valid comment-answers. This does not stack.
- sub forum per comment to discuss the comment. This, most likely, requires another model. 
- Forums can be sorted by users preference when they land on the tag index.
- Using the @ symbol notifies the user they are being referenced/talked too.
- User can favorite tags for ease of access
- on users homepage a rendered list of all recent tags tagged in their favorites
- machine learning to find users (1) commonly answered, (2) commonly looked at tags, (3) most popular upvoted 
  answers. These all of which are intended to help connect the speaker to the speakees in increasing their spread of knowledge while reducing their spent time looking for questions to answer.

##random thoughts without a home:

> Incubators (open groups focused on their own topics) Thinking something like a makers guild or potentially used for buisnesses to help staff
> The tag system: keywords are based on the search system.
1)The goal is to have forums that have tags and are sorted by such. Users cannot add new tags however they can request one to be added.
