# Oversalted

## Project insight

> Oversalted is a website troubleshooting forum focused on creating a all-world-based community enviroment to cater towards food-troubleshooting, recipe developement, muilti-ended corrections to such recipes, and experimentation in hypothetical food-cooking.

## GOALS

- User can make an account
- User can post a question
- User can comment on question
- User can vote on answers
- User can delete their own questions and comments
- Forums are sorted in a tag based organization system
- User can edit their portfolio

## CURRENT Stretch Goals

- Voting system that lets each user vote up to two times per forum on valid comment-answers. This does not stack.
- sub forum per comment to discuss the comment
- Forums can be sorted by users preference when they land on the tag index.
- Using the @ symbol notifies the user they are being talked too.
- User can favorite tags
- on users homepage a rendered list of all recent tags tagged in their favorites
=======

## Notes

> The tag system: keywords are based on the search system.
1)The goal is to have forums that have tags and are sorted by such. Users cannot add new tags however they can request one to be added.

Pageview concept setups
> Public

- [personalized]feed
- questions
- catagories[tags]
- users [to be friends with each other]

> Incubators (open groups focused on their own topics) Thinking something like a makers guild or potentially used for buisnesses to help staff
